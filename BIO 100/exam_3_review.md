# Exam 3 Review

# Day 15  
## Terminology

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Gene | A segment of DNA that codes for a trait. |
| Genome | All your DNA. |
| Allele | The different variations of a gene. |
| Chromosome | "Chapter" in your DNA recipe book. A packet of DNA. |
| Homozygous | A **zygote** is an egg + sperm.<br>Homozygous if the egg and sperm both brough the **same** allele. |
| Heterozygous | The egg and sperm brough **different** alleles to the table. |
| Genotype | What alleles you have. |
| Phenotype | How alleles express (what they look like). |
| Dominant/Recessive Inheritance | When one allele (dominant) completely masks the other allele (recessive). |

Dominant alleles don't take over the world because they are different frequencies. E.g. dwarfism, 6 fingers. Both of those are dominant but they are in low frequency. If you don't have dwarfism or 6 fingers you are likely homozygous recessive.

## Use the knowledge that for every gene, an individual possesses two alleles and that sometimes one allele is dominant and one allele is recessive, to solve genetics problems.

## What is a Punnett Square?

## Hypothesize genetic explanations for inheritance patterns.

## Analyze phenotypic and genotypic data and determine parent genotypes.

## Predict offspring based on parental genotype and/or phenotype.

## Use the terms homozygous, heterozygous, dominant, recessive, genotype, and phenotype correctly.

See the terminology table for Day 15 (today).

## Describe human sex determination.



# Day 16  
## Derive the Hardy-Weinberg equation.

## Determine probabilities of each genotype and phenotype given the proportion of alleles in a population. 7
## Determine allele frequencies given genotypes/phenotypes in a sample of individuals.

## Determine the change in allele frequencies that will occur in a population over each generation.

## Use the Hardy-Weinberg equation to determine allele frequencies in a population given a genotype and/or phenotype frequency and vice versa (assuming the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium).



# Day 17  
## Predict the outcome of the violation of each of the given assumptions of Hardy-Weinberg.

## Predict which assumption has been violated given allelic frequencies of two populations.

## Apply the Hardy-Weinberg equation to real-world scenarios to hypothesize evolutionary causes.    
## Compare expected and actual frequencies to hypothesize evolutionary causes.



# Day 18  
## Draw the process of meiosis.

## Explain where and how the law of independent assortment and the law of segregation are fulfilled by meiosis.

## Use the principles of meiosis to predict offspring outcomes.

## Determine ploidy number (e.g., diploid and haploid) of a cell based on a figure or description of the cell.

## Justify why gametes should have half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell.

## Determine all possible gametes that can result from a given parent.



# Day 19  
## Predict genotypes given phenotypes of family members, from word problems and pedigrees.

## Solve problems about traits expressing complete dominance, codominance, and incomplete dominance.

## Identify and predict genotypes for traits with more than two alleles.

## Perform a monohybrid and dyhibrid cross, using Punnett squares and/or multiplication rules.

## Assess the mode of inheritance for a given trait, using pedigrees or family history.



# Day 20  
## Solve problems about traits expressing sex linkage.

## Solve problems where traits are linked on the same chromosome.



# Day 21  
## Explain the process of gamete formation in males and females.

## Predict genetic results of in vitro fertilization using polar bodies.

## Determine how to increase the odds of becoming pregnant.

## Determine the parent in which nondisjunction occurred, and when during meiosis or mitosis nondisjunction occurred, given a genetic outcome of the daughter cells or offspring.



# Day 22  
## Compare and contrast meiosis and mitosis.

## Diagram the key steps in each phase of the cell cycle and in each phase of mitosis.

## Predict a meiotic or mitotic event in a life cycle given the purpose.

## Predict when and how cancer might occur in the life cycle of a cell.

## Explain and contrast proto-oncogenes, tumor suppressor, and repair genes; predict the effects of a mutation in each.

## Determine at which checkpoint a cancerous cell has experienced a mutation.

## Predict the effect of lengthening telomeres.
