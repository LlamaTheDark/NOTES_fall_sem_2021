# Exam 3 Review

# Day 15  
## Terminology

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Gene | A segment of DNA that codes for a trait. |
| Genome | All your DNA. |
| Allele | The different variations of a gene. |
| Chromosome | "Chapter" in your DNA recipe book. A packet of DNA. |
| Homozygous | A **zygote** is an egg + sperm.<br>Homozygous if the egg and sperm both brough the **same** allele. |
| Heterozygous | The egg and sperm brough **different** alleles to the table. |
| Genotype | What alleles you have. |
| Phenotype | How alleles express (what they look like). |
| Dominant/Recessive Inheritance | When one allele (dominant) completely masks the other allele (recessive). |

Dominant alleles don't take over the world because they are different frequencies. E.g. dwarfism, 6 fingers. Both of those are dominant but they are in low frequency. If you don't have dwarfism or 6 fingers you are likely homozygous recessive.

## Use the knowledge that for every gene, an individual possesses two alleles and that sometimes one allele is dominant and one allele is recessive, to solve genetics problems.

## What is a Punnett Square?

## Hypothesize genetic explanations for inheritance patterns.

## Analyze phenotypic and genotypic data and determine parent genotypes.

## Predict offspring based on parental genotype and/or phenotype.

## Use the terms homozygous, heterozygous, dominant, recessive, genotype, and phenotype correctly.

See the terminology table for Day 15 (today).

## Describe human sex determination.


# Day 16
## Derive the Hardy-Weinberg equation.

Given a dominant allele $R$ and a recessive allele $r$, we need two of either or each to define a geneotype. I.e. $RR$, $Rr$, $rR$, $rr$.

Assuming reproduction is random, let the probability of a dominant allele being drawn be $p$ and the probability of a recessive allele being drawn be $p$. i.e. $p$ and $q$ are your **allele frequencies**. Then your **genotype frequencies** are described as such:
$$
p+q=1
$$
$$
\text{The probability of a getting a homozygous dominant individual is}\\
p*p=p^2
$$
$$
\text{The probability of a getting a homozygous recessive individual is}\\
q*q=q^2
$$
$$
\text{The probability of a getting a heterozygous (and $\therefore$ dominant) individual is}\\
pq\text{ or }qp = pq+qp = 2pq
$$
$$
\text{The Hardy-Weinberg Equation describing the complete probability of all three possibilities}\\\text{(i.e. these values sum to 1)}\\
p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1
$$

Furthermore, your **phenotype frequencies** are described as:
| Phenotype | Frequency |
|-----------|-----------|
| Dominant  | $p^2+2pq$ |
| Recessive | $q^2$     |

###### Recall: The phenotype is based off whether the trait shows or not. In other words, the dominant trait shows if you have the genotype $RR$, $Rr$, or $rR$. These are all separate genotypes, but they all result in the same *phenotype* (the display of the dominant trait).

## Problem Solving Strategy
1. What have you been given?
2. What is being asked for?
* A genotype?
* A phenotype?
* An allele?

Once you know the answer to these questions, use the following definitions and some basic algebra to solve the problem.

| Expression / Equation | Definition |
|-----------------------|------------|
| $p$ | Dominant allele frequency. |
| $q$ | Recessive allele frequency. |
| $p+q=1$ | The probability/frequency of dominant and recessive alleles sum to 1. |
| $p^2$ | The frequency of a **homozygous dominant genotype**. <br>e.g. $RR$. |
| $q^2$ | The frequency of a **homozygous recessive genotype**. <br>e.g. $rr$. |
| $2pq$ | The frequency of a **heterozygous genotype**. <br>e.g. $Rr$ or $rR$. |
| $p^2+2pq+q^2=1$ | The Hardy-Weinberg equation. States that the genotypic frequencies sum to 1. |
| $p^2+2pq$ | The frequency of a dominant **phenotype**. <br>e.g. if the creature has $RR$ or $Rr$ or $rR$, it will display a dominant trait and thus have a the dominant phenotype. |
| $q^2$ | The frequency of a recessive **phenotype**. Notice that this is the same as the frequency of a *homozygous recessive genotype*, because the only way a recessive trait can show is if you have 2 recessive alleles making up the genotype. |

## Determine probabilities of each genotype and phenotype given the proportion of alleles in a population.



## Determine allele frequencies given genotypes/phenotypes in a sample of individuals.

## Determine the change in allele frequencies that will occur in a population over each generation.

## Use the Hardy-Weinberg equation to determine allele frequencies in a population given a genotype and/or phenotype frequency and vice versa (assuming the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium).



# Day 17
## Terminology
## Predict the outcome of the violation of each of the given assumptions of Hardy-Weinberg.
### What does it mean to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium?
The Hardy-Weinberg equation determines how alleles will be distributed using probability. When the HW equation is in equilibrium, it means that the population and its alleles and proportions of those alleles and phenotypes are **not changing**.

## Predict which assumption has been violated given allelic frequencies of two populations.
For a population to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, there are a few requirements. i.e. we assume the following to be true when modeling a population after Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.
1. No **natural selection** is occurring
2. No **gene flow** (immigration/emigration) is occurring
3. No **genetic drift** is occurring
4. Organisms are reproducing at random (no **non-random mating**)
5. No **mutations** are happening

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Natural Selection | There are differences in fitness. |
| Gene Flow | Immigration & emigration of a population or individuals in a population. |
| Genetic Drift | When some outside factor causes there to be a dramatic shift in allele and gene proportions. Two types:<br><li>Founder effect: A few of a population start over somewhere else</li><li>Bottleneck: All of a population are killed off but a few.</li> |
| Non-random Mating | When mating is not random (wow this is helpful). i.e. ***sexual selection***. |
| Mutations | Alleles are changing. |

The Hardy-Weinberg equation describes the situation where a population ***is not evolving***. It is our **null** for evolution. Thus if any of the 5 requirements are not met, then the population ***must be evolving***.

###### <u>IMPORTANT NOTE</u>: the definition table is *not* the list of assumptions. It defines terms in the assumptions, but the actual assumptions are the *absence* of the terms in the table. Just look at the numbered list above.

## Apply the Hardy-Weinberg equation to real-world scenarios to hypothesize evolutionary causes
### Case Study: Malaria
##### You don't need to know all this, it's just an example
* Kenya lowlands have high malaria presence, but low morbidity (death rates)
* Kenya highlands have just recently begun to experience high malaria presence and their morbidity rates are high.

| Thoughts |
|----------|
| From Heather: the people in the lowlands have been exposed to malaria for longer, so they have developed genetic resistances (through mutations). Maybe they're different genetically. |

* Moormann et al., 2003, 2003 hypothesized that highland populations have less protective genes than lowland populations.
* Their test: look at frequency of a known malaria-resistant gene, *Hemoglobin S* (The gene for Sickle Cell Anemia).

If the lowland and highland populations are in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, then their genetics should be the same and not evolving.

So we took some datas and here we got the Hemoglobin A/S genotypes.

| Genotype | Lowland area transmission | Highland area transmission |
|----------|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| HbAA     | 254 (74%)                 | 340 (97%)
| HbAS     | 90 (26%)                  | 12 (3%)
| HbSS     | 0                         | 0

The proportion of A in lowland:
$$
\frac{254*2+90}{344*2}\approx .87
$$
And in the highland:
$$
\frac{352*2+12}{352*2}\approx .98
$$

So if we've got one S you are more resistant. If you get two S's then you're totally immune apparently but a sad side effect is that most of them die in infancy. So here we see some Stabilizing Selection (away from either homozygous genotype and towards the heterozygous genotype).

## Compare expected and actual frequencies to hypothesize evolutionary causes.



# Day 18  
## Terminology
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Chromosome | A packet of DNA - 23 pairs
| Gene | A Recipe for a trait
| Allele | Variations of a gene
| Homologous | Same genes, same order, but **NOT** necessarily the same alleles
| Sister Chromatid | Duplicates of a chromosome

## Something to do with $n$
$$
an=b
$$
* $a$: the number of copies of a gene
* $n$: the number of unique chromosome types
* $b$: the total number of chromosomes

## Draw the process of meiosis.

**Meiosis** is a type of cell division that reduces the number of chromosomes in the parent cell by half and produces four gamete cells. So it's turning diploids into a haploids.

### Sperm production example
Jack has a $2n=46$ structure (like all people). Since it's $2n$ he's got diploid cells.
* The cells that make sperm start out as diploids
* Before we go through meiosis the cell duplicates its chromosomes
* So we get these "ropes" that come out from the edges of the cell and get one of each chromosome.
	* All the homologous pairs line up as pairs in the **metaphase**.
	* Law of Independent Assortment
		* Every single gene is independent from one another. (mostly true)

## Explain where and how the law of independent assortment and the law of segregation are fulfilled by meiosis.

## Use the principles of meiosis to predict offspring outcomes.

## Determine ploidy number (e.g., diploid and haploid) of a cell based on a figure or description of the cell.

## Justify why gametes should have half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell.

## Determine all possible gametes that can result from a given parent.

## Defining Sex
A persons sex is defined by whether they make eggs or sperm. The Y chromosome has something called SRY that makes the gonads fall.
