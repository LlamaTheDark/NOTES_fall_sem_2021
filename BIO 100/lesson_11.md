To summarize, there are 4 main postulates of natural selection:
1.  There must be variation present in the environment and that variation comes through random mutation
2.  These variations must be heritable
3.  The organisms in the population must reach their biotic potential by producing more offspring than can survive due to limiting factors
4.  Some individuals in the population must have greater fitness than others in the population

I like to throw in a 5th requirement that is just kind of a no-brainer, but that is that

5.  The environment must change such that some are more fit than others.

In order for natural Selection to occur (rather than extinction or stagnation), what must be true?
* Varitation through random mutation
* The variation has to be heritable
* Meet the biotic potential but have limiting factors
* Differential fitness
* Environment Changes

Sexual Selection - mate choice
Sexual Dimorphism - male and females are different
* What favors larger males?
	* Intraspecific (within species) competition
* What favors larger females?
	* Interspecific (between species) predation
* Who is the "choosier" partner?
	* The one who invests more in offspring (Bateman's principles)
		* with humans: it's females
