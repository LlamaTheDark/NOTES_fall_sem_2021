# Exam 4 Review
# Day 24
## Compare and contrast viruses and bacteria.

### Pathogens
Most common 2:
* Bacteria
* Viruses

#### Bacteria
Bacteria is **alive**. We know this because they have **ribosomes**.

Shapes:
* cocci
	* circular
* bacilli
	* rod/straight
* spiro
	* spiral

Gram:
* Positive +
	* Has no extra slimey layer
* Negative -
	* Has an extra slimey layer.

Clustering:
* strepto
	* chains
* staphylo
	* clumps

#### Viruses
Viruses are **not alive**. We know this because they do **not have ribosomes**.

* Capsid
* Information
	* DNA
	* RNA
	* single-stranded
	* double-stranded
* Envelope

## Distinguish between gram positive and gram negative bacteria based on a diagram and/or stained slide.

## Identify the different shapes of bacteria and assign the appropriate name.

## Predict the outcome of antibiotic treatment based on pathogen.

## Predict whether an illness is caused by a lytic or lysogenic viruses.

## Identify enveloped and non-enveloped viruses from a diagram.

## Predict how the immune system will respond to both types of pathogens.

## Determine the cause of symptoms for each type of pathogen.

## Predict the mechanism behind vaccines based on immune system function.

## Predict the mechanism behind autoimmune diseases based on immune system-pathogen interactions.

## Make an informed decision about vaccine use.


# Day 25
## Terminology
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Hypertonic | Solution outside the cell has **more** (greater) total solute concentration than the cell. |
| Hypotonic | Solution outside the cell has **less** total solute concentration than the cell. |
| Isotonic | Solution outside the cell with the **same** total solute concentration as the cell. |
| Osmosis | Movement of **water** through/across the membrane. |
| Phospholipid | Building blocks of cell membranes. |
| Simple Diffusion | Movement of molecules that cross the membrane **unassisted**.<br> Goes from high to low concentration (down the **gradient**).<br>No energy required. |
| Facilitated Diffusion | Movement of molecules that need facilitation/help across the membrane.<br>Goes from high to low concentration (down the gradient).<br>No energy required. |
| Active Transport | Movement of molecules across a membrane that goes from low to high (**up** the gradient). |
| Exocytosis | Massive exiting from the cell. |
| Endocytosis | Massive entering the cell. |

###### `-cyt` usually mean sit's got something to do with a cell

##### Water goes where there's more salt. We want equilibrium of saltiness of water.

### Notes from Lecture
* All cells have:
	* Cytoplasm
	* Dominant
	* Plasma membrane
	* Ribosomes
* NOT all cells have:
	* Organelles
* Ribosomes could also be considered organelles tho.

## Identify and describe the function of key organelles and cellular structures.

## Discriminate prokaryotic and eukaryotic (plant & animal) cells by discussing their similarities and differences.

## Predict the type of organism (prokaryote v. eukaryote; plant v. animal) given estimates of cell size and structure.

## Explain the structure of the membrane in relation to its proximity to water and predict how it will facilitate the movement of substances into and out of the cell.

## Predict solute concentration based on the movement of water into and out of the cell.

## Explain the difference between passive (both simple and facilitated diffusion), active, and bulk transport.

## Contrast hypertonic, hypotonic and isotonic solutions and predict what happens to cells immersed in each.  


# Day 26
## Analyze data and make inference about gut microorganisms on human health.

## Analyze data and draw conclusions about the effect of antibiotic disturbance on diversity and abundance of gut microflora

## Predict the outcome of food consumption on diversity and abundance of gut microflora.

## Evaluate the interactions between the gut microbiome and human immune system development. 9

## Analyze the interactions of organisms in gut microflora and judge how positive and negative interactions change the distribution and abundance of species.  


# Day 27
## Predict results of reactions based on enzyme specificity.

## Identify energy reaction curves with and without an enzyme present and calculate the change in overall energy.

## Determine experimental outcomes based on the molecular make-up of each of the macromolecules.

## Identify the name of the monomer and polymer of each macromolecule.

## Analyze different items of food and evaluate which macromolecules are found in each and in what proportions using the 4-4-9 rule.

## Determine causes of discrepancies between calculated calorie count (using 4-4-9) and actual calorie count listed.

## Predict what happens when we have too much or too little of each macromolecule.  

## Respect their own bodies as gifts from our Heavenly Father.


# Day 28
## Model the structure of a DNA molecule.

## Draw conclusions from historical experiments about DNA structure and function.

## Apply Chargaff’s rule, using word problems.

## Explain the function of DNA.

## Apply the principles of macromolecules, cell structure, and disease to the pathophysiology of diabetes.

## Evaluate treatment and eating plans for diabetic patients.


# Day 29
## Transcribe RNA from DNA using information about directionality (5’ and 3’ ends).

## Translate RNA into a protein using the codon table.

## Determine tRNA anti-codon sequences given an mRNA.

## Evaluate amino acid and RNA sequences to identify different types of mutations.

## Discriminate normal from mutated genes, using the original DNA sequences, RNA transcripts and amino acid sequences.


# Day 30
## Compare DNA sequences to determine mutations and predict the effects of those mutations on amino acid sequences.
