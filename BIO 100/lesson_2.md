# Hypothesis Structure
> If ...(my hypothesis is correct)... and ...(my proposed experiment)... then ...(my predicted result)...

Then at the end:
> My hypothesis was (not) supported.

Difference between a hypothesis and a prediction:

Hypothesis relates to the **cause** of the phenomenon you're investigating. Answers a *why*.

Prediction is what you think is going to happen during an experiment.
