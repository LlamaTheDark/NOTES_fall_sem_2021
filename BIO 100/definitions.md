| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Hypothesis | A potential explanation/cause for something. Must be falsifiable to be considered a hypothesis.|
| Placebo | A fake treatment intended to look real for control purposes.|
| Double-blinded treatment |participants and observants don't know which treatment is being conducted.|
| Secondary Source |A source compiled from primary sources.|
| Primary Source | The data collected. The OG.|
| Theory | Multiple Hypothesis|
| Null Hypothesis |A statement of no effect. (assume we have no effect until we can show otherwise). E.g. tossing a coin, the null hypothesis is that there is no bias in the coin, it's just a normal coin. And so any deviation from theoretical probability is due to chance.|
| Statistic | A measure that indicates deviation - how far off we are.|
| Alpha Value | How much risk I'm willing to take. Set before the experiment|
| p-value | Probability of getting a statistic that weird or weirder due to chance. The chance that our null hypothesis is true. If our p-value is small enough ($<\alpha \text{ value}$) i.e. it is unlikely enough that our null hypothesis is true, we can deny our null hypothesis and say our theory is true (the coin is rigged!).|
| Sampling Distribution | Statistic / Frequency Graph. Distribution of possible statistics due to chance.|
| Vestige | Left over from evolution - no function|
| Atavism | Throw back - not everyone has them |
| Homology | Similarity due to common ancestry |
| Analogy | Similarity due to an environment |
| Law of Superposition | Things that are in lower layers of rock are older |
| Theory |
| Hypothesis |
| Law | Descriptive statement that's always true. |
| Node | Common ancestral population |
| Common Ancestor | Population from which 2 species evolved |
| Branch | Changes over time |
| "checkpoints" | Traits / characters  that evolved (somewhere along the branch it evolved, not necessarily at a node) |
| morphological species concept | Physical traits |
| biological species concept | Two types: pre- and post- zygotic. A zygote is a fertilized egg. |
| ecological species concept | Live, resources |
| Phylogenetic species concept | DNA |
| Sympatric Speciation | Speciation due to a non-physical barrier / separation. |
| Allopatric Speciation | Speciation due to an actual physical barrier. |
| Natural Selection | Natural: Environment, Selection: Survived *and* reproduced. \*reproduction of the fittest |
| Evolution | Change over time |
| Random Mutations |  |
| Intraspecific | same species |
| Interspecific | different species |
