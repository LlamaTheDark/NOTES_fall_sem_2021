# Exam 1 Review
* Make observations about natural phenomena.
* Construct plausible hypotheses to explain a phenomenon.
	* Hypothesis relates to the **cause** of the phenomenon you're investigating. Answers a *why*.
	* Prediction is what you think is going to happen during an experiment.
* Design controlled experiments to test hypotheses.
* Identify and control variables in an experimental situation.
	* control just means keep all variables except dependent and independent are kept constant
* Draw conclusions from data.
	* the data supports/does not support my hypothesis.
* Outline the basic steps of the scientific method:
	1. Puzzling Observations
	2. Causal Questions
	3. Hypotheses
	4. Design Experiments
	5. Make Predictions
	6. Conduct Experiments
	7. Results
	8. Conclusions
* Be able to determine the independent and dependent variables in
given experimental scenarios.
* Explain why nothing can ever be ‘proved’ in science.
	* there are too many factors to control for all of them
* Distinguish the difference between correlation and causation.
	* correlation is an observed relationship, causation is a relationship in which one variable directly affects the other.
* Evaluate the reliability of evidence.
	* is it sus?
* Distinguish sources of evidence: primary, secondary, anecdotal.
	* yaeh
* Evaluate whether or not questions can be answered using science
	* does it involve magic or incantations?
* Derive the chi-square statistical test equation  

* Create a null hypothesis
	* done naield it
* Use probabilistic reasoning to define a p-value
* Determine statistical significance using a p-value
	* if $p<\alpha$ then it is significant
* Determine where on a sampling distribution a test statistic will fall
given the statistical significance
	* if significant: fall small probability
	* if not: fall big probability
* Use the word “theory” in scientific terms
> These students have built a model based on evidence they gathered from inside the bag.  These models represent theories and they are built using the BEST evidence we can gather, as scientists.

> Thus, a theory is the BEST model of the truth we can build given ALL the available evidence.

* Distinguish a theory from a hypothesis and understand that theories
guide the formation of hypotheses.
* Develop a hypothesis from a theory and likewise identify the theory
behind a given hypothesis.
