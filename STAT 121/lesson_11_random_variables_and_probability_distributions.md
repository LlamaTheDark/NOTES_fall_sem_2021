# STAT 121 Lesson 11 - Random Variables and Probability Distributions
## Probability Distribution for a <u>Discrete Random Variable</u>
There are two types of discrete random variables:
### 1. Discrete Categorical
E.g. college major. We use a **bar graph** to plot categorical data. The ordering of the categories on the horizontal scale is arbitrary. When interpreting,
* Compare percentages for outcomes.
* **DO NOT** calculate measures of center or spread

### 2. Discrete Quantitative
We can use lots of things for this, but a common one is a **histogram**. When interpreting,
* Compare percentages
* **DO** calculate appropriate measures of center or spread

## Probability Distribution for a <u>Continuous Random Variable</u>
When dealing with continuous random variables, we focus on the probability that a value is in a **specific interval** because they can take on any value within the range. When interpreting,
* Compare percentages
* Calculate appropriate measures of center or spread

For continuous variables, it makes more sense to use a **distribution curve** or **probability density curve**.

## Probability Density Curve
The Probability Density Model:
* Curve is on or above x-axis
* area under the curve = 1
* Where curve is high, data values are dense
* May not describe distribution exactly, but accurately enough for practical purposes (and almost always more accurate than a histogram)


## Learning Outcomes
* Explain what a probability distribution is for discrete categorical, discrete quantitative and continuous variables
* Calculate percentages, measures of center and spread, given the histogram of a probability distribution
* Explain how to model a probability distribution using density curves
* Explain how to calculate probabilities for continuous variables using a density curve
