# STAT 121 Lesson 5 - Producing Data: Experiments
## 4 Principles of Valid Experiments:
1. Control/Comparison
	* Control lurking variables by including **comparison treatments** and **using homogenous subjects**
	* Used to measure placebo effect
2. Randomization
	* Neutralize effects of lurking variables by **assigning** subjects to treatments randomly
3. Replication
	* Assign more than one subject to each treatment group to detect important effects
4. (Double-Blinding)
	* Neither the subjects nor the people who evaluate them know which treatment each subject is receiving
	* Used to prevent experimenter effect
	* Only really matters if subjects are people

## Pitfalls in Experimentation
### Placebo effect
**Definition**: Response by human subjects due to the psychological effect of being treated

**Consequence**: ineffective treatment appears effective relative to untreated subjects

**Solution**:
1. use dummy treatment (saline, sugar pill, etc.) rather than "no treatment" as a comparison treatment **i.e. a placebo**
2. blind subjects as to which treatment they are receiving.

### Diagnostic bias
**Definition**: Diagnosis of subjects biased by preconceived notions about effectiveness of treatment.
	* preconception is a confounded lurking variable

**Solution**:
1. Blind diagnosticians (doctors)
2. studies in which both subjects and diagnosticians are blinded (double-blinded); e.g. Salk vaccine trial

### Lack of realism
**Explanation**: Realism is often compromised by controlled study conditions, choice of homogenous subjects, application of treatments. The realism part is talking about how accurately the designed experiment will reflect reality.

**Examples**:
> Patients participating in medical trials get better care than most other patients. Their doctors are specialists doing research on their specific ailment. They are watched more carefully than other patients. They are more likely to take their pills regularly because they are constantly reminded to do so.

>Using students in a psychology class in place of workers in the real world.

**Solution**:
1. Awareness of hidden bias
2. Admit limitations of experiments

### Hawthorne effect
**Definition**: Phenomenon where people in an experiment behave differently from how they would normally behave; attention/observation bias.

**Consequence**: Inaccurate reporting.

### Noncompliance
**Definition**: Failure to submit to the assigned treatment; refusal to follow the protocol of the experiment.

**Consequence**: invalid results. Noncompliance may undermine an experiement.

**Solution**:
* One or more volunteers

## Data Ethics
* Example: Tuskegee experiment
* Safety and well-being of subjects must be protected
* Individuals must give informed consent before data are collected
* Individual data must be kept confidential.

## Learning Outcomes
* Explain and give examples of the four principles of valid experiments
    * Control/comparison
    * Randomization
    * Replication
    * Double-blinding for human subjects
* Evaluate whether a particular experiment is valid or  not based on the four principles
* Explain the following pitfalls in experimentation and how they can be avoided:
    * Placebo effect
    * Diagnostic bias
    * Lack of realism
    * Hawthorne effect
    * Noncompliance
* Explain the principles of data ethics
    * Protection of the safety and well-being of subjects
    * Informed consent of subjects
* Confidentiality of personal data
