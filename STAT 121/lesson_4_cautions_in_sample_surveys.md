# STAT 121 Lesson 4 - Cautions in Sample Surveys
## Into to study design
We'll discuss 3 main study designs, each useful for its own reasons:
* **observational study**
	* values of the variable(s) of interest are recorded as they naturally occur.
* **sample survey**
	* A type of *observational survey* in which individuals report variables' values themselves, frequently by giving their opinions.
	* **Issues**:
		* **open** vs **closed** questions (how do you feel? *vs* do you feel good (yes/no)?)
			* open questions are less restrictive, but more difficult to summarize.
			* closed questions may be biased by the options provided
			* closed questions should permit open-ended options if possible.
		* unbalanced response options
			* e.g. having more positive options than negative
				* e.g. `I like it very much`, `I like it`, `I hate it`
		* leading questions
		* planting ideas with questions
		* complicated questions
		* sensitive questions
			* Survey method and questions should be carefully designed to elicit honest responses if there are sensitive issues involved.
* **experiment**
	* Researchers interfere, assign values of explanatory variable to the individuals to see how it changes. (an independent & dependent variable kinda thing).
	* Definition: A study design where treatments are imposed on subjects before observing response (manipulations, interventions)
	* Purpose: determine if treatments cause change in response.
		* Advantages (compared to observational study to observational study):
			* no confounded lurking variables
			* can validly draw cause-effect conclusions

### For Experiments to Work
1. Explicitly describe the response variable
2. if possible, choose homogenous subjects
3. choose treatments to control effects of lurking variables
4. assign subjects to treatments such that groups are nearly identical except that they have different treatments; *no confounding* 

## Biases in Sample Surveys
* Under-coverage
	* Some individuals cannot participate in the survey
		* e.g. homelessness
* Non-response
	* Selected individuals refuse to answer or can't be contacted.
		* e.g. hangups, on vacation, refusal to mail census forms
* Misleading Response
	* Selected individuals lie or give inaccurate answers (sensitive issues)
* Interviewer Effect
	* Interviewer influences responses
		* e.g. rude, intimidating to some people, subtle clues or gestures, really cute girls
* Question Order Effect
	* Order of questions promotes certain responses
		* e.g. happiness question precedes debt question, vice-versa
* Question Wording
	* Wording of question leads, misleads, or confuses
		* e.g. loaded words, double negatives, wordy questions


# Learning Outcomes:

* Distinguish observational studies from experiments
* Explain the meaning and give examples of the following terms in the context of experiments:
	* Subject
	* Factor
	* Treatment
	* Response variables
	* Lurking variables
	* Control
	* Confounding
* Describe common ways of experimenting	badly
	* Historical comparison experiments
	* Unreplicated experiments
* Confounded experiments
