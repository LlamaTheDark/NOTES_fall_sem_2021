# STAT 121 Lesson 11 - Normal Distribution and Standard Scores
## Normal Distributions
A famous family of density curves. All normal distributions curves are probability density curves, but not all PDCs are normal distributions.

## Notation Differences
There's different notation for density curves and histograms. See the following table:
| Characteristic | Name | Density Curve (population) Notation | Histogram (sample) Notation |
|---------------|------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Center        | Mean | $\mu$ (mu)        | $\bar{x}$       |
| Spread | Standard Deviation | $\sigma$   | $s$             |

## Characteristics of a Normal Distribution
* Symmetric
* Bell-shaped
* One peak
* Mean = Median
	* $\mu$ is a point of symmetry in a normal distribution.
* $\sigma$ is the distance from the mean to the point where the curve begins to fall less steeply
	* i.e. the average distance all points are from $\mu$
	* i.e. $x$ value of the point of inflection

> Every normal curve has inflection points at exactly 1 standard deviation on each side of the mean. [source](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/wmopen-concepts-statistics/chapter/introduction-to-normal-random-variables-2-of-6/)
