# Professor Decker

# Office Hours
* In office: TMCB 2260
* Monday 2-240 pm
* Tuesday 3-430 pm
* NOTE: 4 hours a week, you can schedule online ones but he's got like 500 students so maybe leave that for the people who have covid or something.

# Course Goals - C S Theory
## Learn 3 key Schemas
  1. Machines and Languages
  2. Logic and Relations
  3. Graphs and Algorithms

## Math-First class
* All programs will be applications of mathematical concepts
* Applied databases
* Each project uses a different piece of math

# Course Assignments
* 5 projects - all connected
* ~25 HWs - due same days as class time
* 1 Midterm
* 1 Final Exam - cumulative, with an emphasis on the back end of the class

## Late Penalty:
* -4 points per day up to two weeks (excluding weekends)
  * i.e. penalty capped off at -20
* Early pass-offs will be rewarded by an extra point (per day I think up to a certain number of days).
* Pass off each using Pass-off Server or with TAs.
* You get 8 attempts at an assignment until you start getting -5 points per attempt

# Class Project - Datalog Interpreter
```
Your Datalog program -> Lexer -> tokens -> Parser -> "meaning" -> Execution
```

* Lexer: creates and recognizes tokens (i.e. what are all the symbols?)
* Parser: is this valid code for the language? (i.e. what do all the symbols mean?)
* Execution: okay now run it

## Mapping of Interpreter to Projects
* Lexer: Project 1
* Parser: Project 2
* Execution: Projects 3, 4, & 5

## Mapping of Schemas to Projects
* Schema 1: Recognizers & Generators - Projects 1 & 2
* Schema 2: Logic & Relations - Projects 3 & 4
* Schema 3: Graphs & Algorithms - Project 5

So we're going to be creating an interpreter for a language called `Datalog`
