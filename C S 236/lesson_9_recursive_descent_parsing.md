# Recursive-Descent Parsing - 9/22/2021
## The Algorithm
1. Create a function for each nonterminal, $A$.
2. Within the function, check input (current token) against the terminals generated by $A$ for a match (this defines which production to use next).
3. Within the function, call corresponding function for nonterminals generated by $A$ for the production matched (this will push the next function on the stack before returning from the current function - recursion).

### Pattern for Parsing Nonterminals
1. Check the current token from our input to match one of the tokens in the FIRST and FOLLOW sets of the nonterminal
	* This identifies which production to parse next
2. Call the parse function for each terminal and nonterminal, in order, fro the chosen production.

### Pattern for parsing Terminals
1. Check the current token from our input to make sure it matches the terminal token.
2. Advance to the next token in input.


## Main Idea
Previous implementations of parsing (table parsing) require (1) an input string and (2) a stack. Recursive descent-parsing makes use of the call stack implemented by the operating system so that the programmer only has to manage the input string.
