## Propositional Logic
### Definition
A **proposition** is a declarative sentence that is either true or false, but not both.

Examples (those checked are propositions):
- [x] The earth is round
- [ ] Are you sure the earth is round?
- [x] The sky is blue.
- [ ] Look up.
- [ ] Why does my head hurt?
- [x] My head hurts.

A **propositional variable** is a letter that represents a proposition. Usually we use $p,w,r,s,\dots$.

The **truth value** of a proposition is either true $T$ or false $F$. It represents the truthfulness of the proposition.

### Propositional Logic
**Propositional logic** is the area of logic that deals with propositions.
