## Lecture Slides
### Markets and Incentives
* Opportunity Cost
	* The value of what you missed out on by performing a certain exchange.
* 4 fundamental principles of Competitive Markets
	1. The Law of Demand: As prices increase, demand decreases
	2. The Law of Supply: As prices increase, supply increases
	3. Equilibrium price: The price for a particular good or service where buyers generally want to purchase the amount sellers offer.
	4. The Role of Profits: High profits attract business and resources, losses do the opposite.
* High supply and low demand means that the price of the good will go down.
* High demand and low supply means the price of the good will go up.
* Some government intervention may be required in producing a market that would fit into the good society.
### Markets or Government
More like markets ***and*** government.

Law of Comparative Advantage:
* Producers specialize in the production of goods where they have the lowest opportunity cost.
* Widest possible gains from trade
* Full employment
* Interdependence

The way the free market is structured uses self-interest to work towards the common good. i.e. prices regulate behavior for the common good.

However, we do need some government regulation (arguably, though I'd say it all be better privatized):
* Prevent coercion and fraud
* Provide money
* Provide infrastructure
* Define property rights
* Enforce exchange agreements

The problem here is that a government strong enough to regulate all this is also powerful enough to destroy the benefits of the market.

### Declaring Independence
What led to the revolution?
* Economics:
	* Colonist trade was being restricted by British; taxes, trade restrictions, land policy
* Leadership:
	* Political Entrepreneurs
	* An educated elite molded public opinion for independence
		* e.g. Franklin, The Adams cousins, etc.
* Local Political Power:
	* Selective Incentives
* Educated Masses
	* Tradesmen like Paul Revere became caught up in the movement.
* Common Sense - Thomas Paine
	* Pamphleteering was crucial in shaping public opinion
* Habits:
	* belief system
	* The colonists were accustomed tot he colonial government with some power in the colonial legislature.


Colonists were not completely united: 25-30% were loyal to Britain and the King.

#### The Atlas of Independence
* John Adams

### Drafting Constitutions
How should we divide power in government and across different levels of government?

It worked so well with George Washington because he was incredibly virtuous. But we have to account for the worst case scenario.

#### Articles of Confederation
It was a defensive alliance of colonies
* Each state retained sovereignty
* There was no single chief executive
* Each state legislature appointed between two and seven delegates to the national legislature.
* Each state had an equal vote - with the assent of nine states required for most actions.
* There was no direct taxation power.
* There was no federal judiciary.

It was... bad
* inflation
* rebellion (Shay's rebellion)

James Madison is "The Father of the Constitution"

At the close of the revolution there were a few common assumptions:
* There's a high level of self-governance among the people.
* The society will rely on free exchange with little government interference.
* The executive branch should be weak to nonexistent.
* Small states are better than large states and most power and sovereignty should be retained by the states.

BUT:
* What if the states are bad?
* What's the relationship between states and national government?

Important People and their Plans:
* James Madison
	* The Virginia Plan
	* Author of Federalist Papers
* William Paterson
	* New Jersey Plan
	* Advocate of rights of small states
* James Wilson
	* Strong nationalist
	* Advocated for a strong, independently elected executive
	* Delegate of Pennsylvania
* Roger Sherman
	* Connecticut
	* Helped draft the Declaration of Independence
	* Proposed the great compromise
* Gouverneur Morris
	* Pennsylvania
	* Drafted the constitution
	* Popular with the ladies (which is definitely somehow relevant)
* George Mason
	* Authored Virginia Declaration of Rights
	* Did not sign constitution partly because he wanted a bill of rights
* John Rutledge
	* South Carolina
	* Strongly defend slavery at the convention
* Benjamin Franklin
	* Represented Pennsylvania
* George Washington
	* Only made 2 speeches, but presided over the convention and consistently supported the Constitution

Each state had one vote in the convention.

### Fights at the Federal Convention of 1787
It's now known as the Constitutional Convention. At the time it was just the Federal Convention of 1787.

Fights were over:
* How to arrange representation
* How much centralized national authority would there be?
* How to divide powers within the national government?

#### A Principled View of the Compromise
The compromise was a compromise of the **virginia plan** and the **new jersy plan**.

> Sovereignty was delegated to both the state and national governments where the House represented people as individuals and the senate represented the states.

It may have passed in part because of slavery. Accepting slavery was a fundamental bargain of the Constitution and the union.

### The Constitutions Incentives
We need to frame the government so as to shape the behavior of future government officials. So what incentives and structures did we put in place and how/why?

* Structure: **bicameralism**
	* 2 chambers: house and senate
	* lots of things make it through one that would never make it through the other
* Separated Elections:
	* House: every 2 years
	* President: every 4 years
	* Senate: every 6 years
	* States: Whenever they want
* Structure: **Filters of Consent**
* Structure: **Enumerated Powers**
	* Declaration of who gets to do what.


There were multiple coalitions
* The Congress Coalition


So here's what went down:
* The government was designed to protect rights and liberties because ...
	1. It checked power by dividing it across several offices and branches and levels
	2. It made sure no single simple majority could seize control of the system in a large republic
* These reforms all lead to one conclusion: any coalition that will govern needs to be **sizable**.
	* To get past bicameralism, filters of consent, and separation of powers in a large republic
* That coalition must also be **sustained**.
	* To get past separated elections when public mood changes
* Coalitions that are not sizable and sustained will not be able to do nearly as much, often leaving policy change out of reach.

### Ratification to Rights
Anti-federalist complaints:
* Proposed national government would be too strong and too distant
* The proposed constitution placed very little emphasis on republic virtue: it was all about incentives and structure.
* The constitution lacked a **bill of rights**.

Federalist response:
* no tyranny because division of sovereignty.
* auxiliary precautions are necessary because you can't depend on people's virtue
* They agreed to pass a bill of rights to which several state conventions suggested amendments.

Best way to protect rights in a good society:
* Set up **processes** to limit government.
* Enumerate rights and rely upon decision-makers to enforce the **standards** for freedom as limitations on government.

### Founding Parties and Interpreting the Constitution
Federalists:
* Led by Alexander Hamilton & John Adams

Democratic Republicans:
* Led by Thomas Jefferson


2 types of Representation
1. PR System
	* Proportional Representation
	* Parliamentary system
	* Coalition Blackmail
		* When a small party forces the rest of the coalition to give in to their demands
2. Single Member Plurality
	* Winner takes all
	* More conducive to a 2 party system


Plurality vs Majority:
* Plurality is the largest proportion
* Majority means more than half
