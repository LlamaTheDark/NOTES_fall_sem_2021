# A HTG 100 Notes Fall 2021, Prof. Jeremy C. Pope
# <u>Act I: The Ingredients of a Founding</u>
## 8/30 - Why Study a Founding?
We are studying the founding of The United States of America as a case study of how a revolution / founding could go. There are both strengths and weaknesses to the way it happened in America and we’ll go over them. The context may be American, but the deeper subject is universal.
How do we get to a good society? A just society?

Central Course Questions:
- How can we foster a society that resolves conflicting interests and fosters beneficial cooperation while maintaining both order *and* liberty?
  - How should we design a government for this society? Should it be powerful or weak? Centralized or decentralized?
  - When and where does a market — something very decentralized — serve our needs? When does it not serve those needs?
  - How have the different types of power — centralized and decentralized — turned out in society?

## 9/1 - The Hope of a Good Society

### The Magna Carta
Also referred to as the Great Charter, a constitutional document aiming to limit the power of King John (kings in general) in 1215. Had very little practical significance at the time, but it carried symbolic significance throughout the centuries.

### The Human Predicament
#### Definitions
* **Tyranny** is the organized expression of the will of an individual or small group. It will generate fear of the state or the dictator or dictators.
  * E.g. the Taliban & treatment of women.
* **Anarchy** is the chaotic expression of individual or small group will. It will generate fear or disorder. The opposite of Tyranny.
* Governments of all kind require **sovereignty**, the ultimate political power and final say over an issue.
  * This inherently carries with it the risk of *tyranny*. However, in it's absence, the way is made for *anarchy*.
* **Regime**

*Which is better?*

***The human predicament cycle:***
```
Tyranny -> Revolution -> Anarchy -> Competing Groups -> Tyranny
```

> In the unlikely event that the leaders of those groups are virtuous, it might be
possible to escape this predicament and move toward creating a Good Society. Unfortunately,
history suggests that the winning faction will institute a new form of tyranny. - Pope, Jeremy

How do we decide what a good society means? What do we value in a good society?
 * Liberty?
 * Equality?
 * Community?
   * community provides a feeling of mutuality
 * Prosperity?
 * Something else?
 * How much **liberty** should be permitted?
 * **equality** vs **equity**.

### The Constitution of Knowledge
* Checks and balances - no one has unlimited control over ideas.
* Any hypothesis can be "floated" (think witch trials).
* *Public* Knowledge is defined by a community and is *decentralized*.
* Authorities cannot control knowledge.

Constitution of Knowledge Notes:
> … think of the constitution of knowl-edge as a funnel. At the wide end, millions of people float millions of hypotheses every day. Only an infinitesimal fraction of new ideas will be proven true. To find them, we run the hypotheses through a mas-sive, socially distributed error-finding process. Only a tiny few make it to the narrow end of the funnel. There, often years later, a kind of social valve — call it prestige and recognition — admits the surviving propo-sitions into the canon of knowledge. People who successfully bring a proposition into the canon are greeted with publication, professorships, promotions, and prizes. Those who follow the rules without scoring a breakthrough receive honorable mention. Those who flout the rules are simply ignored.

* Checks and Balances = Peer Review and Replication
* Not limited to scholars and scientists
* Also includes journalism, the courts, law enforcement, and the intelligence community
* intelligence community: all evidence-based professions that require competing hypotheses to be tested and justified. It’s members hold each other accountable.
* Separation of Powers = Specialization
* Governing Institutions = Scientific Societies and Professional Bodies
* Voting = Citations and Confirmations
* Civic virtues = Submit your beliefs for checking if you want to be taken seriously
* The members of the community that supports and up-holds the constitution of knowledge do not have to agree on facts; the whole point, indeed, is to manage their disagreements.
* Rules of the Constitution of Knowledge:
	* Any hypothesis can be floated - free speech.
	* A hypothesis can “join reality” only insofar as it persuades people after withstanding vigorous questioning and criticism - social testing
	* Only propositions which are broadly agreed to have withstood testing over time qualify as knowledge.
	* Even that which has been agreed to is only considered knowledge so long as testing consistently verifies it.
* By living with this constant verification, we provide ourselves space to work through disagreement without authoritarian oversight. There have been 3 main results:
1. The epistemic constitution disseminated knowledge at a staggering rate. (SO MUCH KNOWLEDGE ALL THE TIME)
2. By insisting on validating truths through a decentralized, non-coercive process, we have ended the practice of killing ideas by killing their proponents. (ideas are bulletproof).
3. The dethroning intellectual authoritarianism and commits liberal society foundationally to intellectual pluralism and freedom of thought.


What makes a government legitimate??
  * Whatever we choose will need to have institutions (a government and a set of laws and rules) and *public* knowledge that are seen as **legitimate** -- in part because we are unlikely to all agree all of the time.

#### Conclusion
The **Good Society**:
  * The **Good Society** is the alternative to anarchy, competition, and a gradual (or sudden) slide towards tyranny.
  * It's an aspiration
  * How centralized should the government be for that society?
  * Real knowledge requires some degree of liberty to build a kind of Constitution of Knowledge.
> *John Rawls* (1921-2002) *argued that the best way to think about the Good Society and how to get a bit closer to it is to imagine a “veil of ignorance.” Suppose that humans could design a society without knowing anything about who they, in particular, were. For example, they didn’t know their gender, race, social status, or wealth.*

Prompt for **Constitution of Knowledge** assignment:
  * Give an example of how the Constitution of Knowledge works in the real world. You example can come from any media type including print, video, and social media. The response should show how the process of knowledge creation works, though the response need not settle the underlying question at issue in the example.

## 9/3 - (LAB) Introductions, Good Societies, and the Nature of Truth

Examples of the Constitution of Knowledge (a floated hypothesis filtered through a decentralized network of people to be accepted as "truth").
 * Covid originated in the Wuhan lab
   * this was initially pushed back by public opinion
   * Revised claim/futher evidence:
      * News organizations are quietly correcting last year's dismissive reports as more evidence comes up.
 * "Not one court has looked at the evidence and said that Biden legally one. Not one."
   * Verdict: state and federal judges - some appointed by Trump - dismissed more than 50 lawsuits brought by Trump or his allies alleging election fraud and other irregularities.

## 9/8 - Human Nature and Collective Action
### Reading Notes
 * KP Ch. 2
 * Plato's Republic
    * To be just > to be unjust ?
        * Socrates argues to be just is among the highest of goods
        > among those  goods which he who would be happy desires both
for their own sake and for the sake of their results.

    * How do we define justice and injustice?
    * Doing injustice vs suffering injustice
        * wherever anyone thinks they can be unjust without consequence, he will be - Glaucon
        * The greatest injustice is to be deemed just when you are unjust (and visa versa)
        > When both have reached the uttermost extreme, the one of justice and the
other of injustice, let judgment be given which of them is the happier of the two. - Glaucon

     * Censorship of art for youth.

 * Little Speech on Liberty, Winthrop
     * two forms of liberty:
         * natural
         * civil / federal

## Lecture Notes
* Remember: we're designing this for actual human beings, not sainted Relief Society presidents or hardened criminals
### Human Nature and Social Design
* Our design of government (or of any social institution) follows from our beliefs
	* The Greeks thought that human nature is innately good
	* the story of Gyges (with the ring of power) - people are inherently bad
	* Plato argues that government should push virtue of some sort... "the tales which the young first hear should be models of virtuous thoughts".
* Which virtues do we pick? Christian virtues vs greek virtues
	* wisdom, temperance, courage, justice
	* meekness, humility, long suffering, patience
* David Hume
	* Man is self-regarding. That's what matters. Human beings care about themselves.
* Gross Generalizations of Human Nature:
	* **Economists**: individuals are motivated by self-interest
	* **Psychologists**: individuals are motivated by subconcious desires and biases (not fully aware of and may not even be able to explain)
	* **Biologists**: Humans are a product of their genetic endowment
	* **Marxists**: Individuals are controlled by their class or environment
	* **Optimists** & **Pessimists**
	* **Self Interest** vs **Virtue**
		* people are a complex amalgam of both interests and virtue - remember the cake on the train story
* Just saying that things are complex is useless so let's do better.

### Collective Action
* Definition: Can the two farmers work together?
	* unless the farmers can be **trusted** to collectively act to generate a collective benefit, it is more in their self interest to not work.

* Is there any solution?
	* In some sense, the rest of the class isabout solutions for cooperation, but here are some **key** ones in politics.
		* Selective incentives
		* rip i didn't get the rest of them and he switched the slide

### Centralized vs Decentralized
* John Winthrop
	* Human beings have such a dark side that we can only give them civil liberty (not natural liberty).
* What mechanism controls society?
	* self-control through public virtue
	* coercion by government to control self-interest
	* structures or institutions that use self-interest or virtue for the common good
* What do you now believe is the best and most useful basis for designing institutions like government and public policy?

## 9/10 - (LAB) Human Beings in Collective Action

## 9/13 - The First Colonial Communities
### Jamestown
* founded in 1607
* The prototypical "corporate community"
* Captain John Smith
	* reaaally liked himself
	* was a hero of the colonies
	* the marriage of sugmacock's daughter with an englishman kept peave for a while (until 1622 whose war lasted a decade).
* Choices by the Powhatan
	* raid or trade?
		* initially more trading than raiding, but there's always tension
* Native tribes needed thousands more acres than European Immigrants did.
	* this is because of agricultural developments and differences in how they viewed the world (the *nature* of the world if you will).

### Infant industries
* Glassblowing - really dumb idea
* Tobacco - Makes the colonies RICH because the natives love it and they don't have to ship it across the ocean.
	* starts generating revenue for people back in london
	* "Corporate Model" for a society
* Idea that society can be governed by a social contract in contrast to a "state of nature" thought experiment
	* birthed the Mayflower Compact
	* create an elected authority
	* What really moves people are ideas that they take *into* their souls. Says in the mayflower compact AND in Alma. I don't remember the exact chapter.
* God's Elect
	* John Calvin preached a morality of hard work and constant moralism
	* Predestination
	* Calvinists
		* can't be sure that God has "predestined" you.
		* focus on money and success as a sign that you've been chosen
* Moral Self-Governance
	* the puritans looked for every family to govern themselves -- and watch their neighbors.
* The irony of Jamestown - House of Burgesses (1619)
	* Birthplace of American democracy
	* Birthplace of American slavery
	* may not have been completely representative and just, but it was more democratic than any other place on the planet at the time.
* Decentralized: "Open Lands"
	* The fact that there was a lot of open space served as a constraint
* Models of Authority and **Centralization** in the "New" World
	* Centralized from London: corporate governance
	* Decentralized from London (but locally centralized): social compacts
	* Local Democracy - House of Burgesses & New England town meetings
	* Slaveholding - as locally centralized, and dehumanizing, as things could get
* First attempts at European community
	* The first colonial communities are experiments in what and how much to centralize
	* Though they are *very* .. and he switched the slide yay


## 9/14 - Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (FILM)

## 9/15 - Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (FILM) & English Principles and Revolutions
* John Locke's 2nd something

* Rule of Law

* King James
	* he did the bible (well his scholar ppl did)
	* came to the throne after the death of queen elizabeth the first
	* was king of scottland
	* doesn't like parliament
	* The law said that he could request a ship in times of need.
		* But really he could do it whenever he wanted
	* He used "ship money" - when ppl couldn't provide ships, he said they could do money instead
		* used it to evade parliament
		* they didn't like it so they killed him
		* "KING IS SUBJECT TO PARLIAMENT"
	* parliament rule lasts a while, but ultimately craps itself
	* 1649 - behead charles *
	* 1653 - 1659 - oliver cromwell rules the commonwealth
	* 1660 - charles II, charles I's son.
		* continues contest
	* 1685 James II--a catholic-- succeeds his uncle charles II
		* ppl don't like catholics
		* so parliament said if you wanna hold office in parliament you gotta publicly dissavow catholicism ("Test Act ")
	* the whigs organize a revolution - the glorious revolution of 1688
		* King William and Queen Mary promise to rule subject to the consent of the parliament
	* **John Locke** helps them provide intellectual grounds for the revolution in his essay: **The Second Treatise**.
		* famous work on social contract theory
		* personal sovereignty
		* rejected divine rights of king

### Locke's Argument
1. In a "state of nature" everyone lived in a state of freedom and equality.
2. Humans invented government to secure their rights in this state.
3. Government's *only* purpose is to protect the rights of the citizens.
4. The consent of the government is required for the legitimacy of the government.
5. Any government that does not protect the rights of the citizenry should be abolished.
