# Description
1. Write a paragraph analyzing and explaining the difference between priesthood keys, priesthood ordinances, priesthood offices, priesthood authority, and priesthood power.
2. Read Doctrine and Covenants 13:1; 20:38–67; 84:19-21; and 107:1–40, 58–100. Look for the scriptural descriptions of the Melchizedek and Aaronic Priesthoods, the various priesthood quorums and offices in each priesthood, and the respective duties and responsibilities of the two priesthoods.
3. Based on your assigned readings above, write a paragraph in which you (A) list which keys belong to the Melchizedek Priesthood and briefly explain what they do, and (B) list which keys belong to the Aaronic Priesthood and briefly explain what they do.
4. Doctrine and Covenants 84:33–40 , which is known as the "oath and covenant of the priesthood,," is often discussed only in terms of male priesthood office holders. Yet the promises made in those verses apply to all those who receive the ordinances of the priesthood, male and female. BYU Professor Barbara Morgan Gardner wrote, "It appears wise then, while discussing something as important as the oath and covenant of the priesthood ... that women understand that they too will be blessed to 'receive all that my Father hath.'” ("Helping Female Students Rise to Their Spiritual Privileges," Religious Educator 18, no. 3 (2018): 117–39). Take a few minutes and read Doctrine and Covenants 84:33–40. In your own words, list the specific promises in those verses, and how they may be available to all God's children, male and female.

	Priesthood keys are the authority to direct the use of the priesthood on behalf of God's Children. The definition for priesthood authority is the authorization to represent God and act in His name. These definitions have some overlap, but the key difference is that keys are used to *direct* the use of the priesthood, while authority refers to any authorization to utilize the priesthood. These keys are linked to offices of the priesthood. Offices of the priesthood are divisions of priesthood authority to perform authorized ordinances. Priesthood power is God's power obtained through living righteously. Finally, we have priesthood ordinances which are sacred acts performed by the authority of the priesthood. To consolidate this information with an example, take baptism by immersion. The keys of baptism by immersion are required in order to perform the ordinance of baptism by immersion. These keys must be extended by a member of a priesthood office, thus granting a holder of the priesthood the authority to perform the ordinance, should he be worthy (i.e. should he be living righteously to have access to God's power).

Aaronic Priesthood Keys Held:

The bishopric holds the keys and authority of the Aaronic priesthood.
* ministering of angels
	* It means they have access to call upon angels
* gospel of repentance
	* Key to the sharing of the gospel
* baptism by immersion

Melchizedek Priesthood Keys Held:

Holds the keys of all the spiritual blessings of the church
* mysteries of the kingdom
* knowledge of God
* the kingdom of heaven
* sealing power
* keys of the gathering of Israel

	(A) The keys held by the Melchizedek priesthood include but are not limited to the keys to the mysteries of the kingdom of God, the knowledge of God, the kingdom of heaven, sealing power, and the keys of the gathering of Israel.

	(B) The keys held by the Aaronic priesthood include but are not limited to the keys of the ministering of angels, the gospel of repentance, and baptism by immersion.

	All of these keys are used to direct the use of the priesthood on Earth. All priesthood keys are available to us because they've been dispensed from Christ to the Prophet, and from the Prophet to the rest of the church. For example, the bishopric holds the keys of the Aaronic priesthood. So in order to perform a baptism, a priesthood holder would have to get permission (authority) to perform the baptism. The bishop could not, however, dictate or reveal truths about the mysteries of the kingdom of God because he doesn't hold those keys. Each of the keys grants access to something different.

	While it's often interpreted in terms of priesthood offices, there's actually no mention of explicit priesthood offices. It simply talks about obtaining the two priesthoods and the magnifying of callings. We know that both men and women are given priesthood callings and are given priesthood authority to exercise those callings. Thus in magnifying them both men and women can gain access to the promised blessings in these verses. Those promises, specifically, are to be "sanctified by the Spirit unto the renewing of their bodies" and receiving "all that my Father hath". Jesus Christ is speaking.
