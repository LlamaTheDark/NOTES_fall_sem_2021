# Description

As learned in class, the law of consecration has not been done away with and is still in effect.  It is a divine law of the Church (D&C 42:30-31) which requires that you, as God’s agent, dedicate the time, talents, and means that God has blessed you with to building up God’s kingdom on earth as he directs through his living prophet and by the Holy Spirit.  The only limits to how fully we live the law of consecration is ourselves.



For this analysis assignment I want you to reflect on how you can best live the law of consecration that you have covenanted to do.  Elder Robert D. Hales said, “In the temple we are prepared to and promise to live the law of consecration” (Elder Robert D. Hales, Ensign April 2013 “Stand Strong in Holy Places”). The Church’s booklet  Preparing to Enter the Holy Temple says that “We covenant to give of our resources in time and money and talent—all we are and all we possess—to the interest of the kingdom of God upon the earth” (Preparing to Enter the Holy Temple, 35).  To complete this assignment:



1. Review the law of consecration and the principles of consecration discussed in class—ownership, stewardship, agency and accountability (see your notes or posted class power point).
2. Prayerfully reflect on all that God has given you—your life, your abilities, your opportunities, your means, etc. Also prayerfully reflect upon what the Lord has formally asked us to do to live the law of consecration today—make God and family our top priorities, pay full tithes, generous offerings to the poor, fulfilling callings, service, missions, etc.
3. After prayerful reflection, write a brief paragraph under each of the following headings about how you feel you can fully apply and live the law of consecration in your life today.
* Consecrating Time
* Consecrating Money and Possessions
* Consecrating Talent
* Consecrating Yourself and Life

Copy and paste your reflection paragraphs in the “explain your answer” box at the bottom of the questions for Analysis Assignment #7 in LS.

# Response
## Consecrating Time

	Consecrating time; There are many ways in which we as members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints are asked to consecrate our time. Some of them are our Sunday worship service, our quorum meetings & activities, and ward service projects. Not just this but we also are asked to spend time during the week individually to prepare for Sunday worship & school by reading current Come Follow Me section. Doing all these things will help me to more fully consecrate my time, but there is also so much more that I can do. Personal scripture study will help me come closer to God, and thus be able to better serve him and his Children. This takes time to do. One huge example of consecration of time (as well as the following 3 sections) is missionary service. I'll talk more about this in "Consecrating Yourself and Life" but (for me) 2 years of sacrifice in such a key part of my academic career is a significant sacrifice when viewed from a temporal perspective. In choosing to serve a mission I've consecrated those 2 years of my life in the service of God.

## Consecrating Money and Possessions

	Consecrating Money and Possessions; Again, there are ways by which we are already asked to do this with fast offering and tithing settlement. These are great ways to consecrate our possessions. Personally, I don't have a lot of money or possessions, and in thinking of ways I can consecrate them, I think firstly of my laptop and phone. These incredibly powerful pieces of technology are capable of so much good and (naturally) so much bad. I can consecrate these by choosing to use them for good - to further the work of God. While this could me any number of things, I'm referring to family history work - indexing. I started to index over the summer and I don't mean to brag or anything but I was kind of an indexing machine. When school started I stopped because I got busy, but I think it's important to find the time (consecrate my time) to do it anyways. This will help me serve people on both sides of the veil.

## Consecrating Talent

	Consecrating Talent; To consecrate talent, we have to first nurture and develop our natural talents into skills so that we can then use them to serve. One thing I want to be able to do is read piano sheet music (at least at the hymn level) with confidence so that I am always ready to play hymns for sacrament meeting or whatever occasion. In doing so, I'll be serving all in the congregation by helping them to feel the spirit. I do know how to play the piano but I'm still working on my sight-reading. Actively working to improve our talents is also an example of the consecration of our time.

## Consecrating Yourself and Life

	Consecrating Yourself and Life; I think this is really just a culmination of the previous three sections as well as a catch-all for whatever we haven't consecrated yet. Something somebody said in this most recent General Conference had something to do with how this persons life was changed when he started to involve the Lord in everything that he did, including his academic studies. This was something that I had considered of course, since I was at BYU, but it is something I want to take further than saying a prayer before a class, test, or before I begin doing homework. I want the spirit to be with me in every word that I read, to maximize my understanding and learning. And it's also something I want to expand past just academia. If I can life in such a way as to have the Lord helping and guiding me every step of the way, then I will be able to most effectively consecrate my time and serve others the way the Lord needs me to serve them. As I said before, missionary work is a great example of consecrating your time, money and possessions, talent, and your life to the Lord. But it doesn't have to end with our return from our mission - in fact it shouldn't. Something somebody else said in the most recent General Conference was that to sacrifice something was to make it holy. So by sacrificing our lives - not in the death way but the service way - we can consecrate ourselves in the service of our fellow beings and therefore our God.
