# Focus Points:
#### What is "Doctrine"?
* In most basic dictionaries it means "something that is taught" or "teaching instruction"
*

#### How to view individual statements made by Church leaders
"A single statement made by a single leader on a single occasion often represents a personal, though well-considered, opinion, but is not meant to be officially binding for the whole Church."
#### 4 types of doctrine (TYPE)
1. Core, eternal teachings/doctrine
   * unchanging truths of salvation.
   * Baptism for salvation
   * We speak to God through prayer
   * essential ordinances
   * the nature and characteristics of God
   * our relationship to God
2. Supporting teachings/doctrine
   * elaborate, descriptive, timely teachings expanding on core doctrine.
   * Baptisms for the dead in our dispensation
   * We pray in the name of Jesus Christ (Christ is part of all moments where we interact with Deity)
   * Jesus bled from every pore
3. Policy teachings/doctrine
   * timely statements related to applications of supportive and eternal teachings.
   * Do baptisms for the dead in temples, gender specific
   * Opening / closing prayer in sacrament meeting, using respectful language, close our eyes bow our heads (not in deaf wards tho).
4. Esoteric teachings/doctrine
   * unknown or only partially revealed or yet to be revealed truths.
   * How baptisms for the dead are accepted in the spirit world.
