# Midterm 1 Study Guide

*You may use your scriptures during the exam. You may NOT use any other resources such as notes, websites, and other resources on Gospel Library except your scriptures. The exam is composed of **forty-six (46) multiple choice questions**. Forty-five (45) questions are worth **two (2) points**. The final question is worth **four (4) points**. The exam does not have a time limit.* So that's a total of $45*2+4=94$ points. To get below 90%, you would have to miss 5 regular questions or 3 regular questions and the last question.
