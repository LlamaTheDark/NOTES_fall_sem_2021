# Notes From Class
* 4-step process to translating scripture? You gotta know this bruv

### The First Mission to the Lamanites
* The First Mission to the Lamanites
	* D&C 28:89, D&C 30:5, D&C 32
	* Parley P Pratt, Peter Whitmer Jr., Oliver Cowdery (leads the mission), Zaiba Peterson
	* Wasn't very successful with the Native Americans, but there were a lot of important things that happened because of the trip.

1. It demonstrated the Church's commitment to preach to the descendants of the Lamanites of the Book of Mormon.
2. It helped establish a stronghold for the Church in Kirtland, Ohio, where the missionaries found numerous unexpected converts
3. It led to identifying Jackson County, Missouri as the site for the New Jerusalem and brought JS there in the summer of 1831 to meet the missionaries and lay the foundation of the City of Zion.

D&C 37 they are called to gather in Ohio. D&C 38:32 they are told why.

### Parley P Pratt
* Lives in Kirtland Ohio area, feels desire to sell property and move. They decide they'll visit family in the New York area.
* They on a boat, and when they get near the palmyra area, he's like I sense something here and goes and meets Joseph Smith.
* Then he gets called on his Mission.
* He's like yo I got friends in kirland ohio on the way we could talk to them.
* Then TONS of people from Kirtland join the church.
* Read (Pratt, *Autobiography of Parley P Pratt*, pp. 36, 38-39)

## Law of Consecration
The saints are told they'll receive "the law of the Church" when they gather in Ohio. This is the *Law of Consecration* (D&C 42).

Is the Law of Consecration in practice in full today? YES.

> The law of sacrifice and the law of consecration have not been done away with and are still in effect. (President Gordon B. Hinkley)

We have the *law* and the *implementation*. The way that the law is lived has changed, but the law itself **has not changed**.

Look up **Law of Consecration** on ChurchofJesusChrist.org

### How *was* it lived?
The following are 3 different things:
* All Things Common
	* Giving over to the Church. They'd consecrate their belongings to the Church, and their portion would be given back. In practice, most people got back almost exactly what they consecrated or more. They then become "stewards" over those belongings, which now belong to the Lord.
* The United Order, now United Firm
	* The United Order was **a consecration-based business organization of Church leaders**. Essentially the business side of trying to *implement* the Law of Consecration and All Things Common.
	* Joseph Smith, W. W. Phelps, Sydney Rigdon, Martin Harris, A. Sidney Gilbert, Bishop Partridge, Hyrum Smith
	* Ultimately failed
		* debt, persecution, membership not keeping covenants
		* Eventually a conference voted to dissolve it.
		* The Lord directed how the Firm's properties be reorganized in D&C 104.
	* The failure of the United Order and All Things Common does **not** mean the Law of Consecration failed. They are separate.
* The Law of Consecration
	* Based on 3 doctrines:
		* D&C 42:32
		1. ***Agency***: the power to act
		2. ***Stewardship***: The things that we have to act upon (D&C 42:53-54)
		3. ***Accountability***: God requires an accounting of every steward and agent
		* These principles (especially 1. and 2.) are key differences between this and communism.
	* The Commandments Governing the Law of Consecration (D&C:42)
		* (4-9) Go and gather Israel
		* (18-29) Obey God's laws
		* (30-35) Remember the poor
