## RESPONSE
	Although there are 4 primary accounts of the First Vision, they all follow a distinct path. That path is: (1) Joseph had concerns about the world and existence, (2) and so he searched for an answer through prayer, and (3) God the Father appeared with His son Jesus Christ and gave Joseph guidance.

	First, it was clear Joseph had concerns, but the focus of these concerns shifts throughout the difference accounts. In his 1832 account, he outlines that he has "importent concerns of for the wellfare of [his] immortal Soul". In his 1835 account he says concerning the religious contention at the time, "I knew not who was right or who was wrong and concidering it of the first importance that I should be right, in matters that involved eternal consequences". So while his focus shifts to deciding on a church to join, his underlying concern is still of eternal consequences. The 1838 account denotes, "so great was the confusion and strife amongst the different denominations that it was impossible for a person young as I was [...] to come to any certain conclusion who was right and who was wrong." And likewise the 1842 account says, "I found that there was a great clash in religious sentiment" and that "God could not be the author of so much confusion". The most uniqueness is found with the 1832 account.

	Secondly, Joseph's concerns brought him to prayer and a vision of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. The 1832 account describes it as such: "I was filled with the spirit of god and the <​Lord​> opened the heavens upon me and I saw the Lord". Joseph doesn't explicitly state the appearance of Jesus Christ and Heavenly Father's testimony of him in this account. In the 1835 account, however, he does: "a personage appeard in the midst, of this pillar of flame which was spread all around, and yet nothing consumed, another personage soon appeard like unto the first". These two personages were Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Uniquely, this is the only account that describes the timing of the Father and Christ's appearance (that is, that Christ appeared first). The 1838 account denotes a similar experience: "When the light rested upon me I saw two personages (whose brightness and glory defy all description) standing above me in the air. One of <​them​> spake unto me calling me by name and said (pointing to the other) 'This is my beloved Son, Hear him.'" This is the account most familiar to me. Lastly, there is the 1942 account which denotes again that Joseph prayed in the grove, "I retired to a secret place in a grove and began to call upon the Lord", and shortly thereafter "saw two glorious personages who exactly resembled each other in features, and likeness, surrounded with a brilliant light which eclipsed the sun at noon-day."

	Finally, Joseph is presented with guidance and comfort for his concerns. Remember that Joseph's focus changes throughout these accounts, and there were also different audiences for each (namely the 1842 account, or "Wentworth letter"). In both the 1832 and 1835 account, Joseph conveys Heavenly Father's words to him, "Joseph <​my son​> thy sins are forgiven thee." (1832 account), "he said unto me thy sins are forgiven thee" (1835). As the focus of Joseph's writing shifted, as did what he decided to emphasize in his accounts. The 1838 and 1842 accounts both recount the Lord's instructions with regard to which church's teachings should be trusted and joined. The 1838 account says, "He again forbade me to join with any of them and many other thing[s] did he say unto me which I cannot write at this time", and the 1842 account says, "And I was expressly commanded to 'go not after them,' at the same time receiving a promise that the fulness of the gospel should at some future time be made known unto me."



## What do I believe about the first vision and why?

## RESPONSE
	In thinking about the First Vision recently, and what I believe about it and why, the idea of "levels of doctrine" comes to mind. There are many differing details in each account of the First Vision, and different things are focused on in each account. We also know that some things about the accounts could be wrong simply due to variability in memory or other uncontrolled factors (such as Joseph recounting his age at the time of the vision incorrectly). So logically, the question I ask is - where is the line drawn between truth and falsehood in these vision accounts? How can anybody know with confidence that these events truly transpired, and in the way that they've been recorded?

	The answer is, of course, by study and faith. Going back to the levels of doctrine, I see core principles and doctrines that exist in the accounts of the first vision and those are: Joseph Smith had the faith to ask God for the knowledge that he didn't have; Heavenly Father appeared to Joseph Smith with His son, of whom he testified; Heavenly Father forgave Joseph Smith of his sins, and gave him guidance and comfort in response to the questions and concerns of his soul. I know these things to be true because I have (now) studied the accounts of the vision, prayed to know of their truth, and received a spiritual confirmation. "By the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things" (Moroni 10:5). Even as I was just reading the accounts of the First Vision again, I felt the spirit confirming that these core principles are true. May some details vary? Sure. Is every account 100% accurate? Who knows!? What matters to me are the core principles that impact Joseph Smith's journey to helping restore the Church of God on the Earth.
