# Notes from Class
* Joseph learned when finishing the BoM that "many plain and precious things" have been removed from the Bible, causing people to err (1 Nephi 13:29).

* The **visions of Moses** (**Moses 1** today).
	* Was **Moses** a Christian? Joseph Smith's Moses is a Christian, as are the prophets in all his translations.
	* Adam and Eve are also Christians.
* For the next 3 years after the Church was organized, Joseph's primary work is translating the Bible.
	* Began June 1830
* There are a total of 3410 changed verses in the JSK from the KJV of the Bible.
	* We only have 1/3 of them because the Community of Christ church has the copyright to 2/3s of them.
* Songs of Solomon is **not** revealed scripture.
* Half of our D&C revelations came during the time period that Joseph was translating the Bible, with many of them coming form the JST directly.
	* D&C 93 is the last one we get before July 2930

The JST is and isn't finished.
* Compare Malachi 4:5-6 with D&C 2 and D&C 128:18
* When clarity needs to be added changes are made.

> He should not be stumbled if the prophet should translate the bible forty thousand times over and yet it should be different in some places every time, because when God speake, he always speaks according to the capacity of the people. - Brigham Young

## We can all translate scripture and we must (not permanently and canonically but...)
* Substantiate Externally
	* Bible translations
	* Modern prophets
	* Historical context
	* Other scriptures
* How to translate scripture:
	1.
	2.
	3.
	4.


Examples:
* 1 Samuel 3:1

Samuel is doing temple work. The Lord's word was very important and there were not a lot of visions.

* Matthew 16:19



* D&C 88:68


# Focus Points
## What does it mean that Joseph Smith “translated” the Bible?
* It is trying to take language and understand context and intent of the Bible.

## What kind of changes did Joseph make while translating?
*

## How many of these were there, and how many are included in the LDS Bible today?

## How did the Church acquire and publish the JST?

## Where we get the Book of Moses and the Pearl of Great Price


# Forgetting Curve Review
* Why are written revelations sometimes altered?
* How were D&C revelations received?
* How does a document become canonized in the D&C
* What book of scripture is the foundation of the Church in the latter days?
	* The D&C. Think about why this is. How is it different in purpose to the Book of Mormon?
