Translating the Scriptures (Again)

As discussed in the week’s readings and in class, the word “translation” does not only imply turning one language into another, but it also means “interpretation.” Much of the work of Joseph Smith’s “translation” of the Bible was his prophetic interpretation of the Bible.  Under direct inspiration and authority from heaven he interpreted and wrote the words as though he were the original writer of the text himself, speaking in the language of Isaiah, Matthew, Paul, etc.

Your analysis assignment this week is to do your own translation of a scriptural chapter.  In fact, I want you to translate a Joseph Smith translation.  Yes, Joseph Smith himself said that he could have translated verses differently. After quoting Malachi he said, “I might have rendered a plainer translation to this, but it is sufficiently plain to suite my purpose as it now stands” (D&C 128:18). This quote from LDS philosopher Adam Miller may help:

> Joseph produced, as God required, the first public translation of the scriptures we now share.  But that work, open-ended all along, is unfinished.  Now, the task is ours.  When you read the scriptures, don’t just lay your eyes like stones on the pages.  Roll up your sleeves and translate them again. . . . With a prayer in hand, finish what Joseph started. . . . You and I must translate these books again.  Word by word, line by line, verse by verse, chapter by chapter, God wants the whole thing translated once more, and this time he wants it translated into your native tongue, inflected by your native concerns, and written in your native flesh.  To be a Mormon is to do once more, on your own small scale, the same kind of work that Joseph did (Adam Miller, “Letters to a Young Mormon,” (Provo, UT: Maxwell Institute for Religious Scholarship) 2014, 32-33).

1. You are to re-translate (or re-interpret) at least 10 verses from Moses chapter 3. You can do more if you wish.
2. Begin your study with an earnest prayer.  Ask Father in Heaven to bless you with the Spirit to inspire you. Pray to understand, by the Spirit, the intent of the original writer.  Also pray to understand, by the Spirit, the meaning of that intent for you today.
3. Read all of Moses chapter 3.
4. Pick a series of verses that stand out to you that you feel you can interpret.
5. Do NOT rely on the footnotes for the interpretation.  Read the original words on the page. You interpret those words. However, bring to bear on these words all that you have learned on the subject through the words of modern day prophets, seers, revelators, and other scripture.
6. Render and write down your verses in your translation (at least 10 verses).
7. Once you finish your *personal “translation,” write a brief one page double-spaced reflection on what you learned by experience about the process of a) the Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible and b) studying and interpreting scripture for yourself.
8. Fill out the questions for Analysis Assignment Quiz #6 in Learning Suite and copy and paste your written responses in the "explain your answer" boxes provided.



###### *\*It goes without saying, but I’ll say it anyway so we are all clear:  this is an experiential exercise to learn about scripture, scripture writing, scripture translation, and scripture interpretation.  What you write in no way means anything official or is for anyone beyond yourself. Official scriptural interpretation for the church is the purview of prophets, not learning experiences in assignments at BYU religion classes.*

### Original 10 verses:

2 And on the seventh day I, God, ended my work, and all things which I had made; and I rested on the seventh day from all my work, and all things which I had made were finished, and I, God, saw that they were good;

3 And I, God, blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it; because that in it I had rested from all my work which I, God, had created and made.

7 And I, the Lord God, formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul, the first flesh upon the earth, the first man also; nevertheless, all things were before created; but spiritually were they created and made according to my word.

15 And I, the Lord God, took the man, and put him into the Garden of Eden, to dress it, and to keep it.

16 And I, the Lord God, commanded the man, saying: Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat,

17 But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it, nevertheless, thou mayest choose for thyself, for it is given unto thee; but, remember that I forbid it, for in the day thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.

20 And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but as for Adam, there was not found an help meet for him.

21 And I, the Lord God, caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam; and he slept, and I took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh in the stead thereof;

22 And the rib which I, the Lord God, had taken from man, made I a woman, and brought her unto the man.

23 And Adam said: This I know now is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of man.



### "Translated" verses

2 I, the Lord God, took a break from organizing the world for a time equal to a seventh of the total time I would take. I looked at the things I made and noted that they were good in nature and integrity.

3 I then blessed and sanctified this seventh period of time as a time of rest, and as an example to the people I would create.

7 From the same ingredients that I, the Lord God, made the earth, I made the body of a man, and bound a spirit with it to create a living soul. Regardless of the order I create the earthly and temporal bodies of the things I'm making, I created them all spiritually prior to my creation of the Earth. All this was done according to my word.

15 I put the man's soul that I made in the garden of Eden so that he could learn to take care of it.

16 & 17 You can eat any fruit here, but if you eat the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil, you're going to ensure your physical death. I'm going to tell you that you're not allowed to eat it, but I still value your agency so I'm going to let you make the choice yourself.

20 Adam named all the living creatures that I, the Lord God, made. They all had friends and family but Adam was pretty alone.

21-23 I, the Lord God, made Adam fall asleep and I used Adam's likeness (which is my own) to create a woman to be his partner. And Adam was thrilled about it.

### Reflection
Once you finish your *personal “translation,” write a brief one page double-spaced reflection on what you learned by experience about the process of a) the Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible and b) studying and interpreting scripture for yourself.

I learned a few important things through my experience of trying to translate. The biggest struggle for me was trying to understand the intent of the verses. The thing is that the verses like lots of phrases and cases in modern language today, mean different things based on the context and the purpose for which they were written. For example, some random person you see on the street telling you that your hair looks like trash means something different than if it's your mother telling you. With your mother, you know it comes from a place of love and wanting to help you. With the dude on the street, he's just grumpy. Likewise, there's lots of ways to interpret scripture. Something I learned about my own personal study and interpreting of scripture is that I need to pay more attention to the context and the intent of that which I'm reading. Too often I'll just read a snippet or a quote of a verse or 2 without the context, or I'll see it posted on social media or something like that. The context and intent makes all the difference and that was made super clear in my attempt to interpret these verses for myself.

Furthermore, I have gained a stronger testimony of Joseph Smith as a Prophet and the restorer of the Church of Jesus Christ in the Latter Days. It was very difficult to "translate" those verses for me. I can't imagine doing it with something of actual divine substance for a whole church.
