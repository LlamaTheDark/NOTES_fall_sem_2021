## Endowment
**def.** Endowment means to receive a "capacity, power, or ability" or "A natural gift, ability, or quality".

Try explaining the ordinance and covenants associated with:
* Baptism
* Sacrament

Okay now try explaining endowment. Bruh idek. That's what we're gonna fix. Why is it so hard to define what endowment is, compared with baptism and sacrament?
* We do baptism and sacrament early on and/or weekly in our lives.
* We hear the sacrament prayer every week.
* We don't learn about the endowment until later in our lives usually
* The endowment is more complicated
* There is uncertainty around what we're "allowed" to talk about with regard to the endowment.

### Promised Blessings of the Endowment
* Help us to become high priests and high priestesses of God.

In a June 1831 Conference, the following important stuff happened:
* Joseph ordains the first "High Priests"
* A bunch of other stuff happened too
* Some people were able to see God and Jesus Christ, but most were not. Why not?
	* D&C 67
	* because they were fearful

##### The promised endowment of power
* D&C 67:3
	* The blessing offered is to be able to see God
* D&C 67:10-13
* D&C 88:67-69
	* "the great and last promise"
* D&C 88:74-75
	* Organize the School of the Prophets to sanctify a group of people to fulfill the great and last promise to see God.
	* This is the purpose of the School of the Prophets: to prepare people to receive their endowment and enter into the presence of God.
* D&C 88: 119-121, 123, 132-133, 138-139
	* Contains some specific requirements to prepare them to see God
* A pattern to approach the Lord was starting to be revealed:
	* create a holy temple
	* be cleansed from your sins by a ritual washing
	* commit to be holy, obedient, and chaste
	* consecrate your life to serving God and man by covenant
	* Pray with uplifted hands to heaven.
